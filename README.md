# DiscordJS-Bot-Template

Setup Guide:

Step 1.
- Create a bot Client at [Discord Developer Portal](https://discord.com/developers/applications).

Step 2.
- Copy your bot token. This will be needed in the ```config.json``` file, and will be used to login to your bot!

Step 3.
- Open [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download).

Step 4.
- Create a new project folder, and open the terminal and run the following command `git clone https://github.com/DiscordJS-Bot-Template` to clone this repository into your visual studio!

Step 5.
- Updating config variables, open the `config.json` file and between the `""` place your token inside the quotes, now, we need to choose a prefix, this can be anything you want, some common prefixes include `!`, `?`, so try to avoid a prefix that would collude with other bots in your guild!

Step 6.
- Launching the bot, In your terminal run `node index.js` and the client will login, the first few logins might take a bit, so wait for the console to log that your bot is online!
